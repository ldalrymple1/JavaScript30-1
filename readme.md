# Brief

Having recently completed General Assembly's *Software Engineering Immersive* course I though Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 day challenge would be a good way for me to keep up with my technical skills whilst I am looking for a job. I am also a big fan of Wes Bos and love his podcast **Syntax.fm**!


Below is my #JavaScript30 blog and please look at my GitHub for my completed solutions.

## Day 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit
Although this was going over the basics I really enjoyed making it. Also ahvign worked in React for the majority of the course at GA, it was particularly weird going back to vanilla JS and manipulation of the DOM!

## Day 2 - JS and CSS Clock
Nice little exercise.

## Day 3 - CSS Variables
I knew you could create variables in Sass but I didn't know you could in CSS.

## Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1
I remember when I first learnt array methods I found them really tricky but the more you do them the better you get and now I love them (I never thought I would say that)! I'm very comfortable with them all except reduce which sometimes can confuse me.

## Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery
Visually this looked great. Would have preferred to do more JavaScript in this one but at least I learnt some more CSS tricks.
