# Brief

Having recently completed General Assembly's *Software Engineering Immersive* course I thought Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 day challenge would be a good way for me to keep up with my technical skills whilst I am looking for a job. I am also a big fan of Wes Bos and love his podcast **Syntax.fm**!


Below is my #JavaScript30 blog and please look at my GitHub for my completed solutions.

### Day 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit
Although this was going over the basics I really enjoyed making it. Also ahvign worked in React for the majority of the course at GA, it was particularly weird going back to vanilla JS and manipulation of the DOM!

### Day 2 - JS and CSS Clock
Nice little exercise. It was good to go over both dates and animation, something I haven't looked at in a while ⏱. The setInterval and setTimeout functions brought back memories of making my first Vanilla JavaScript game... a Shrek themes Frogger!

### Day 3 - CSS Variables
I knew you could create variables in Sass but I didn't know you could in CSS.

### Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1
I remember when I first learnt array methods I found them really tricky but the more you do them the better you get and now I love them (I never thought I would say that)! I'm very comfortable with them all except reduce which sometimes can confuse me.

### Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery
Visually this looked great. Would have preferred to do more JavaScript in this one but at least I learnt some more CSS tricks. 

### Day 6 - Type Ahead
Felt weird going back to fetch having used axios for so long. It was also good to go over JavaScript's use of promises. This challenge was especially useful given that I have recently been given a code test where the user has to highlight text and store it somewhere so this has given me some more ideas 🤠.

### Day 7 - Array Cardio Day 2
Good to go over even more array methods as we all know how useful they are! I always get confused between splice, slice and split 🥴.

### Day 8 - HTML5 Canvas
I had a lot of fun with this task and it was good to do something I had never done before. I was surprised how easy it was to get the colour to change by just adding 
```
hue ++ 
```
if 
```
isDrawing === true
```

### Day 9 - Dev Tools Domination
Loved this session - Who ever knew there were so many different forms of the console.log(), a JS developer's best friend!

## Day 10 - Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes
I actually found this much harder than I had anticipated and decided to code it again at the end of the day without looking at the solution. One third of the way through!

## Day 11 - Custom Video Player
Going over more key concepts and cementing them in my brain. Good to go over progress bars again as they can be quite tricky, but once you've got the hang of them they are fine.

## Day 12 - Key Sequence Detection
Wow, I did not know about the cornify_add() function until now...🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄

## Day 13 - Slide in on Scroll
Funky little idea that I might use at some point

## Day 14 - Objects and Arrays Reference VS Copy
Key Learning -> If you reference an array, it will always update to the original array therefore best to make a copy. There are three ways of doing this:
```
arrayName.slice()
[].concat(arrayName)
[...arrayName]
```
Similarly with objects you should make a copy otherwise you are making a reference to the original object.
